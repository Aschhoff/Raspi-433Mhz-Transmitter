** Raspi-433Mhz-Transmitter**
A pure Python RF Transmitter. 

This transmit tool based on a config file where you combine user friendly name and used protokols.

Call it with tx433_pi.py and as argument the user friendly name of the tx433_config.py
eg.  tx433_pi.py Switch_Bath
Futher as an expert you can create and add your own encoder files in the directory tx433_encoder
I have implemented a power socket Quigg7000, the ev1527 protokoll and a spezial encoder for a remote bell.
Feel free to implement your own.
