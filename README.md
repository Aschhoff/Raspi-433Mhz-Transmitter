**Raspi-433Mhz-Transmitter**

A pure Python RF Transmitter. 

This transmit tool based on a config file where you combine user friendly name and used protokols.\n

Call it with tx433_pi.py and as argument the user friendly name of the tx433_config.py\n
eg.  **tx433_pi.py Switch_Bath**
Futher as an expert you can create and add your own encoder files in the directory tx433_encoder\n
I have implemented a power socket Quigg7000, the ev1527 protokoll and a spezial encoder for a remote bell\n.
Feel free to implement your own.\n
